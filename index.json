However, most question answering approaches assume a single source of information (usually images or text). This is a weak assumption as information is often sparse and scattered. Next, the source of information can also be vision, text, speech, or any other modality. In this work, we move away from the simplistic assumptions of VQA and explore methods that can effectively capture the multimodal and multihop aspects of information retrieval. Specifically, we analyze the task of information source selection through the lens of Graph Convolution Neural Networks. We propose three independent methods which explore different graph arrangements and weighted connections across nodes. Our experiments and corresponding analysis highlight the prowess of graph-based methods in performing multihop reasoning even with primitive representations of input modalities. We also contrast our approach with existing baselines and transformer-based methods which by design fail to perform multihop reasoning for source selection task.\n","date":1638316800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1638316800,"objectID":"df837cd423cd184434dd5196d1205408","permalink":"https://paritoshmittal12.github.io/project/graphconv/","publishdate":"2021-12-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/graphconv/","section":"project","summary":"A graph convolution based approach to select multiple relevant sources (text or images) of information for multi-hop question answering.","tags":["Deep Learning"],"title":"Multi-Modal Multi-Hop Source Retrieval using Graph Convolutions","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Several applications of computer vision e.g. autonomous driving, warehouse management etc. are nearing deployment in real-world.

In this paper, we propose an autoregressive prior for 3D shapes to solve multimodal 3D tasks such as shape completion, reconstruction, and generation. We model the distribution over 3D shapes as a non-sequential autoregressive distribution over a discretized, low-dimensional, symbolic grid-like latent representation of 3D shapes. We demonstrate that the proposed prior is able to represent distributions over 3D shape spaces conditioned over information from an arbitrary set of spatially anchored query locations. This enables us to represent distributions over 3D shapes conditioned on information from an arbitrary set of spatially anchored query locations and thus perform shape completion in such arbitrary settings (e.g. generating a complete chair given only a view of the back leg). We also show that the learned autoregressive prior can be leveraged for conditional tasks such as single-view reconstruction and language-based generation. This is achieved by learning task-specific 'naive' conditionals which can be approximated by light-weight models trained on minimal paired data. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed method using both quantitative and qualitative evaluation and show that the proposed method outperforms the specialized state-of-the-art methods trained for individual tasks.","tags":[],"title":"Non-sequential Autoregressive Shape Priors for 3D Completion, Reconstruction and Generation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Paritosh Mittal","Shankar M Venkatesan","Aloknath De","Himanshu Pandotra","Viswanath Veera","Rohith Aralikkatti"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.   --  Create your slides in Markdown - click the Slides button to check out the example.

This technology is now on the verge of actual deployments. However, security threats, privacy, and trust management remain the most significant concerns. C-ITS relies highly on node cooperation and trust as vehicles take the decision based on the information received from the roadside network infrastructure. This information should be accurate and reliable to ensure proper functioning of the system. However, the presence of a misbehaving or compromised node in the system can lead to catastrophic results for both safety and traffic efficiency. It is therefore essential to detect misbehavior and defend the C-ITS against it. Although various studies have proposed misbehavior detection at the vehicular plane, the study that explores the machine learning capabilities to detect misbehavior at infrastructure plane is not present. Thus, in this paper, we propose a solution to detect misbehavior at the infrastructure plane of C-ITS that employs the predictive capabilities of Deep Learning. We compare the performance of Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models of Deep Neural Network.","tags":[],"title":"Misbehavior Detection in C-ITS Using Deep Learning Approach","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sathisha Basavaraju","Paritosh Mittal","Arijit Sur"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

The initial studies have demonstrated that memorability is an inherent characteristic of an image and have found many high-level image properties (such as emotions, saliency, object statistics, popularity, aesthetics, etc.) which influence image memorability. This paper sheds light on the relationship between image memorability and two image features motion and depth which, to the best of our knowledge, is still unexplored. Experimental analysis reveals that motion and depth cues have a positive influence in determining image memorability. Further, the paper presents a novel deep learning model, FOD-MemNet, to exploit motion and depth cues along with object features to predict image memorability. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed FOD-MemNet model outperforms the current state-of-the-art model by achieving a rank correlation of 0.655 which is near to human consistency (œÅ = 0.68).","tags":[],"title":"Image Memorability: The Role of Depth and Motion","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Web application using MongoDB, Neo4j and MySQL was developed that displayed videos to users.
